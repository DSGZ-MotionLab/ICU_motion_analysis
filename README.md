# ICU_motion_analysis

Matlab code for analyzing motion features from thigh-fixed motion sensors in an ICU setting.

## Description

This repository contains Matlab code that reads accelerometer data, processes it to extract various motion features, and exports the results to a CSV file. 

## Files

- `ICU_motion_analysis.m`: Main Matlab script for motion analysis.
- `README.md`: This readme file.
- `data`: Folder containing sample accelerometer data.

## Data

The `data` folder contains sample accelerometer data used for testing the Matlab scripts.

- `data/sample_left.csv`: Example CSV file with accelerometer data.
- `data/sample_right.csv`: Example CSV file with accelerometer data.

## Usage

1. Run the `ICU_motion_analysis.m` script in Matlab.
2. Follow the prompts to select the data folder and save the results.
